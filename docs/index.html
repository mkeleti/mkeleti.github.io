<p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl, originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult 
    female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>

    Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins 
    in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the 
    clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa 
    originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a>, the 
    chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by 
    the 5th century BCE.[6] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the
     mid-15th century BCE, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come
      from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of
       Thutmose III.[7][8][9]

    "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird. But thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. "Chicken" as a specie, and in older sources was typically referred as common fowl or domestic fowl.[20]
    
    Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[21]</p>
